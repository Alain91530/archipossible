# A simple and basic example of an openstreetmap with React and Leaflet

## A simple map with markers using leaflet

Just clone the repo to install, it has been done with create-react-app.

If you want to sea how to use leaflet with React, just check the different commits. Each one add a new working feature to the map. By checking the differences you'll be able to see how I impl√©mented it.

On the 20th, may 2018 it goes through the flowing states:

- rendering a simple map
- adding a standart marker
- adding a popup to the marker
- adding a different layer
- adding several map layers and user can choose his prefered one
- adding a set of markers
- styling the popup
- customizing the markers

You can see a live demo [here](https://www.depannum.fr/archipossible)


Come back often and check for new features and how they have been added.
